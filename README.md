This repository holds three of the pipelines that I established in my internship. Among other things, I worked with data that consisted of behavioral experiments in a rat model of Parkinsonâ€™s disease with and without epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. The pipelines here process this data. 

With the PCA and neural analysis pipeline you get out three of the plots that were displayed on my poster!
